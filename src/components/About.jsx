        <h3>About Me</h3>
        Hello my name is Justin Park. I'm professional chef and a US Marine. I am an 0861 Scout Observer/0621 Radio Operator and hold the rank of Corporal in the Marine Corps Reserve. I am a recent grad of the UCLA full stack web development program. I was teaching myself how to code after work and loved the challenges it provided and decided to make the difficult decision to change my career and pursue web development. My knowledge ranges from front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and React.js to back-end technologies covering Node, Express, MySqL, and Mongo. I am optimistic in my prospects of becoming a programmer. Besides coding, I love food, being outdoors and collecting Funko Pop toys.
